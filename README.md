#rock_paper_scissors_noGUI

My first project besides making a Google Homepage clon.
Started with making a game that uses case-insensitive inputs through the prompt window and comapres it with a randomly generated computer choice, than displays all results in the col results in the consolensole.
In the console you could see:

 *player choice
 *computer choice
 *player and computer scores, updated each round
 *outcome message for each round
 *final outcome
 
 Next task was to create an GUI with some required elements
 Fist task was to create a new branch from the original project to learn some basic Git workflows.
 The next tasks where:
  *Create three buttons, one for each selection
  *Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
  *Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
  *Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
  *Refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this.
  
 The next task, again, was about learning more Git workflows like, how to merge these changes back to our main branch and than do some cleanup,
 both locally and in the remote repo.
